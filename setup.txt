Environment Setup (Linux)
- Windows Not Recommended
Python Environment Setup
Using Conda (Recommended)
1. Create a new conda environment using the command:
conda create --name <env_name> python=3.9.18

2. Activate the environment using the command:
conda activate <env_name>

3. Install the required packages using the command:
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
(Note: If you are using only CPU or Windows without Visual Studio, use `requirements/requirements-cpu.txt` or `requirements/requirements-bkup.txt` instead of `requirements/requirements.txt`)


Weights, Dataset setup.
Weights
1. Download the weights from the links provided above.
- FasterRCNN Model weights setup:
  - Download the zip file from the following link: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f56K0_etroH6bY5bwGfseDLFBahGTHxI/view?usp=drive_link)
  - Extract the zip file in the root directory of the project.
  - Create a folder named `weights/fasterrcnn` in the root directory of the project.
  - Place the downloaded weights (`fasterrcnn-resnet50.pt`) file in the `weights/fasterrcnn` folder.
(Refer to the Github repository link above for detailed information and folder structure)

- TrOCR Model weights setup:
  - Download the zip file from the following link: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dwiiz-qS_bvMuLWXozs8DQQz4snN11OJ/view?usp=drive_link)
  - Extract the zip file in the root directory of the project.
  - Copy the folder `trocr_base_v2` to the `weights/` folder.
(Refer to the Github repository link above for detailed information and folder structure)

Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded or set up any way you want. There are no restrictions on the dataset folder structure.

Running the code for Inference
- Please use the `test_predict.py` file to run the inference code.
- Refer to the command below for running the code:
python3 test_predict.py --dataset-path dataset/test --image-extensions=".jpg,.png" --odometer-detector-weights weights/fasterrcnn/fasterrcnn-resnet50.pt --ocr-weights weights/trocr_base_v2 --output-path output.csv --save-images --save-images-path=save_images
- The above command will run the inference code on the test set and will save the results in the `output.csv` file.
- The above command will also save the images with the bounding boxes and text drawn in the `save_images` folder.
- RUn the command `python3 test_predict.py --help` for more information about the command line arguments.
